# Integration Branch

This branch integrates features from both the `matchmaking` and `security-and-roles` branches.

## Key Features

### From `matchmaking` branch:
- Battle UI and Monaco Editor integration
- Multiplayer lobbies
- Supabase database integration
- Code execution functionality

### From `security-and-roles` branch:
- Security enhancements
- Role-based access control
- Admin and Premium role management
- Secure logging

## Integration Approach

The integration is being performed incrementally by merging specific features from each branch, rather than attempting a full branch merge. This helps avoid complex merge conflicts in files that have been heavily modified in both branches.
