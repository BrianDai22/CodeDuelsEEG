## Testing Process

1. Start with unit testing of individual components
2. Perform integration testing of connected components
3. Conduct end-to-end testing of critical user flows
4. Test security boundaries with different user roles
5. Test error handling and edge cases

## Common Issues to Watch For

- Authentication state synchronization issues
- Missing UI components or styles
- Backend API connectivity problems
- Permission checking inconsistencies
- Real-time updates not functioning
- Browser compatibility issues

## Testing Environment Setup

1. Ensure all environment variables are properly configured
2. Firebase and Supabase services must be running
3. Test with multiple user accounts with different permission levels
4. Test across different browsers and screen sizes
