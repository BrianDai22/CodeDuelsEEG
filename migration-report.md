# Migration Report: Component Structure Reorganization

## Summary

We successfully migrated the project from a technical-concern-based architecture to a feature-first architecture. This included reorganizing files, updating import paths, and fixing related issues.

## Changes Made

1. **Created new directory structure**
   - `src/features/` - Feature-specific components, hooks, and contexts
   - `src/shared/` - Shared components, hooks, and utilities
   - `src/ui/` - UI components library

2. **Fixed import paths**
   - Updated all `@components/ui/...` imports to `@ui/...`
   - Updated all `@contexts/...` imports to respective feature contexts
   - Updated all `@components/common/...` imports to `@shared/components/...`
   - Updated all `@components/layout/...` imports to `@shared/components/...`
   - Updated all `@components/features/...` imports to `@features/.../components/...`

3. **Created utility scripts**
   - `fix-all-imports.sh` - Fixed import paths across the entire codebase
   - `fix-pages-imports.sh` - Fixed import paths in feature pages
   - `fix-toast-imports.sh` - Fixed toast-specific imports
   - `fix-feature-imports.sh` - Fixed imports in feature components

4. **Fixed specific component issues**
   - Updated `toast.tsx` to resolve TypeScript errors
   - Fixed button closing tag in `toast.tsx`
   - Updated import paths in toaster component
   - Fixed circular dependencies

## Benefits

1. **Improved maintainability**
   - Code is now organized by domain/feature rather than technical concern
   - Related code is co-located, making it easier to navigate and modify

2. **Better scalability**
   - New features can be added without modifying existing code
   - Features are independent and self-contained

3. **Clearer boundaries**
   - Clear separation between UI components, feature code, and shared utilities
   - Reduces the risk of circular dependencies

4. **Easier onboarding**
   - More intuitive structure for new developers
   - Follows modern React best practices

## Next Steps

1. Review any remaining type errors in the codebase
2. Ensure all components are correctly using the new import paths
3. Cleanup any unused components or files
4. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
